# 50 Days, 50 AI Automations üöÄ

Hey! I'm Sai Akhil, AI/ML Developing Engineer https://www.saiakhil.space and I got tired of doing the same repetitive tasks every damn day. So I'm building 50 AI-powered automations in 50 days using n8n.

Why? Because I'm lazy and I'd rather spend an hour automating something than 5 minutes doing it repeatedly for the rest of my life.

## What's This About?

I'm documenting my journey of building real-world automations that actually save time. No fancy corporate solutions - just practical stuff that makes life easier.

Each automation:
- Solves a real problem I (or others) face
- Uses free/cheap tools only
- Includes the full n8n workflow JSON
- Has actual results (time saved, efficiency gained)

## The Automations So Far

### ‚úÖ Day 1: Smart Email Classifier
**Problem:** Drowning in emails, missing important stuff  
**Solution:** AI reads emails, identifies urgency, stars important ones, drafts responses  
**Time Saved:** 2+ hours daily

### ‚úÖ Day 2: Social Media Multi-Poster  
**Problem:** Rewriting the same post for LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook  
**Solution:** Write once, AI adapts for each platform's vibe  
**Time Saved:** 20-30 mins per post

### ‚úÖ Day 3: AI Invoice Processor.
**Problem:** So I'm staring at a stack of invoices thinking about manually typing all that data into Excel.

**Solution:** Built an automation that reads invoices (PDF or text) and dumps everything straight into Google Sheets.

**Time Saved:** Hell lot of time daily (can't be specific with the time)

### ‚úÖ Day 4: Gmail auto-replier.
**Problem:** Spending an hour daily on repetitive email responses - rate inquiries, thank you notes, basic questions. The same answers, different people.

**Solution:** An AI-powered workflow that reads unread emails, categorizes them (promotional, newsletter, question, request), and drafts contextual responses only for emails that actually need replies. Creates drafts, not automatic sends - maintaining human oversight.

**Time Saved:** ~1 hour daily of email hell.

### ‚úÖ Day 5: AI Content Repurposing Machine.
**Today's Build:** An AI Content Repurposing Machine that turns one piece of content into 6 platform-optimized versions. Because manually rewriting the same post for LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, newsletter, and blog is SO 2023.

**Time Saved:** ~1 hour daily.

### ‚úÖ Day 6: Whatsapp AI Lead Responder
**Today's Build:** An AI Content Repurposing Machine that turns one piece of content into 6 platform-optimized versions. Because manually rewriting the same post for LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, newsletter, and blog is SO 2023.

**Time Saved:** ~1 hour daily.

## Want to Use These?

1. Install n8n locally (it's free): `npm install n8n -g`
2. Grab the workflow JSON from any day's folder
3. Import into n8n
4. Add your credentials (Gmail, OpenAI, etc.)
5. Done! Customize as needed

## Tools I'm Using

- **n8n** - The workflow automation tool (self-hosted = free)
- **OpenAI API** - For the AI magic (costs pennies per workflow)
- **Google Sheets** - For storing data (free)
- **Various free APIs** - Whatever each automation needs

## Got Ideas?

I need 48 more automations! If you have repetitive tasks that annoy you, drop an issue or hit me up. Might build your idea next!

## FAQs

**Q: Do I need coding skills?**  
A: Nope! That's the whole point. Just copy-paste and configure.

**Q: How much does this cost?**  
A: n8n is free (self-hosted). OpenAI API costs like $0.01-0.05 per automation run.

**Q: Can I use these for my business?**  
A: Hell yeah! That's why I'm sharing them.

**Q: What if I get stuck?**  
A: Open an issue. I'll help when I can.

## The Real Goal

Look, we're all wasting time on stupid repetitive tasks. If even one of these automations saves you an hour per week, that's 52 hours per year. That's a whole work week you get back.

Let's automate the boring stuff and focus on what matters.
